# React Reusable UI components

In this React project I made some UI components on top of Material UI. Given custom theming options using props.
These components can be used in the entire app and we can apply our theme.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm i
### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
